# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the BIOL116 lab manual!

The material in this manual is designed to be used as part of the BIOL116 labs. It integrates heavily with additional material that can be accessed only through the [BIOL116 Canvas page](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/90147), including assignments, quizzes, and other material that is specific to this year\'s offering of the course. As such you will be expected to access BOTH this website and Canvas regularly.

**Your first lab**, Lab 1, is asynchronous (meaning that you complete it online, in your own time during that week) and the material is posted exclusively on [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/90147). **Your second lab**, Lab 2, will be your first chance to physically enter the lab, and meet your TA and your fellow lab mates. The material for Lab 2 can be found in this text, under the [Lab 2A](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-116-Lab-Manual/lab-2a-the-process-of-science.html) and [Lab2B](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-116-Lab-Manual/lab-2b-research-project.html) headings (with links to this content also on Canvas).

The rest of the labs will continue to alternate between asynchronous, online labs, and synchronous, in-person labs. **For in-person labs it is vital that you attend the lab in which you are registered** (Check your registration online to be sure of where you are supposed to be!).

There\'s much more information about what to expect from labs, the grading policies, and the weekly schedule in the [Canvas Module for Lab 1](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/90147). For now, we will say that we\'re looking forward to the start of term, and to meeting you (both virtually and in-person). Science is amazing and exciting and cool, and we can\'t wait to share our love of science and biology with you!
