## Introduction to the Process of Science {-}

### Objectives {-}

At the end of this lab students should be able to: 

- List the main components involved in the \"process of science\" 
- Provide examples of scientific activities and / or list where these activities would generally fit in the \"process of science\" chart. 
- Explain - in your own words or through examples - what is meant by each of the following statements regarding the process of science:
  - The process of science involves testing ideas with data 
  - Though they can be supported by evidence, it is often difficult for scientific hypotheses to be proven or directly observed 
  - Scientific knowledge is subject to change as new evidence and perspectives emerge 
  - The process of science is often non-linear 
  - The process of science involves observation, exploration, discovery, testing, communication, and application 
  - Scientists can use multiple methods - experiments, observations, models - to test their ideas 
  - Science involves curiosity and creativity 
  - Scientists work together to share their ideas 
  - Scientists aim for their studies to be replicable 
  - Over time, scientific ideas or hypotheses that are supported by multiple methods and replicated in various studies become established theories that are widely accepted by the scientific community 

### Discussion Questions {-}

1. What is science?
2. What do scientists do and how - in general - do they do it? Discuss this with a partner.

## Mystery Cylinders {-}

**Mystery Cylinders An exercise in the scientific process**

Imagine a container, a cylinder that you are unable to open, and you cannot see inside. How would you manage to figure out what is inside the cylinder? What would your thinking process be?

This activity is broken down into 3 steps:

1. Observe
2. Share and Collaborate
3. Submit

### Phase 1 â€“ \"Observe\" your cylinder {-}

Outside of opening the container, you have the option to hold it, shake it etc. What types of observations would you like to make? During this activity, you and your group will be able to interact with the cylinder. Think about the question you are addressing and how you would go about answering it. 

Work in groups to come up with three suggestions of ways you can manipulate your cylinders to try and determine what is inside. Remember that not all of your initial ideas will be plausible - you don\'t always have all the ideal tools available to you. You do not have an X-ray machine in the lab ðŸ˜Š. Offer three possible tests that could likely be done in lab. 

Designate one person in your group to write down all observations and information you attain during your experiment.Following this, you and your group now must try to reach a consensus about what is inside the interior of each cylinder.

**Note** If you do not take extensive notes throughout the experimentation process - electronically or on paper - you will not have the information that you need to complete this assignment.

### Phase 2 - Share & Collaborate {-}

Your instructor will then help your group to discuss findings with other groups.

* Discuss whether you are using similar techniques to analyze your cylinders.
* Collaborate with others to see if you can arrive at a consensus guess for the interior of your cylinder(s).

### Phase 3 â€“ Submit for marks {-}

Once you feel confident with your predictions, you will need to submit them to Canvas for marks. There is a separate file posted with the assignment instructions.

### Discussion Question {-}

1. With your original group, make a list of the **specific things** that you did during this activity and how / why they are a part of doing science - e.g. twisting the cylinders \= ??

**NOTE** Wait for your instructor before proceeding to the next section *Science Flowchart*.

## Science Flowchart {-}

### A Simple Flowchart {-}

Study the simple science flowchart with your instructor:

### A Complex Flowchart {-}

Now let\'s view the complex science flowchart:

### Class Discussion {-}

Follow your instructor\'s directions as a class to place examples of the types of things you did in the mystery box activity into each circle. See the list generated for the previous discussion question.

This discussion marks the end of the first part of this lab (Lab 2). If you have not already done so, make sure you have the information you need to complete your submission of the Mystery cylinder assignment before the end of the day. Once you leave your lab you will not have the opportunity to come back if thereâ€™s something you forgot or missed. 

When youâ€™re ready, you can proceed to Part 2 of Lab 2, where the research project is discussed.

## Mystery Cylinder Assignment {-}

**Purpose** To help you learn how to keep good lab notes and make predictions.

**Rationale** A key piece of science is to record the work you do so that you can learn from what worked and what didn\'t. Keeping accurate records of the work that you do can make all of the difference. Patents and other scientific discoveries can be worth a lot of money to those that can prove that the work they did was theirs. This requires accurate and honest note keeping.

**Instructions** For this assignment, you will be working with your teaching assistants to determine the contents of a \"mystery cylinder\".â€¯ You will have the opportunity to see, touch, and manipulate each cylinder in the lab and you are expected to work within your lab group to come up with 3 experiments that your group will conduct. Once you have completed the experiments, you will be expected to make a prediction regarding the contents of your \"mystery cylinder\".

If you do not take extensive notes in your lab notebook throughout the experimentation process, you will not have the information that you need to complete this assignment. â€¯ 

**Submission** For this assignment, you will submit your predictions for the contents of your mystery cylinder, along with a rationale that explains how the experiments you ran, which were documented in your lab notes, support your prediction.

You have two options for submission of this part of your work:

1. You can submit a 1-page written prediction, with rationale. It should be no more than one page (double-spaced, Arial 12pt font, 1cm margins)
2. You can submit a video (no more than 2 min)

You will upload your mystery cylinder assignment on [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca) via the dedicated assignment entitled \"Mystery Cylinder Submission\". This assignment is **due before 11:59 pm the day of your lab**. 

While it is encouraged that you work together prior to submission, your lab submission must be entirely your own work.

This means: 

* No copying and pasting from other sources - even if you plan to \'tweak\'. This is not your own words. 
* Do not work it out together, and then alter the final draft to make it look less similar. Figure it out together, and then go away and write your final submission yourself.
