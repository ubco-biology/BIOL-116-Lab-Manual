# Lab 6: Data Collection {-}

Now that you have conducted your pilot experiment and saw how it went, you are ready to collect some data.

Make sure you have worked through any major changes to your experimental methodology with your teaching assistant and you have carefully documented everything that happened during your pilot week (Lab 4). This information will come in handy when it comes time to explaining your results, but for this week you can just focus on collecting data for your research!
