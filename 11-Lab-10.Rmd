## What is a Research Poster? {-}

Posters are commonly used throughout the academic community to communicate scientific research to fellow scientists. What is great about a research poster is that you have the opportunity to summarize in a clear and concise way all that you have done and what you have found in a very attractive and informative format. 

Posters are typically a mix of text, figures, tables, graphs and other data. The researchers stand out in front of their poster and present their poster to a small audience (in some cases just one person will be there). Posters also allow for more in-depth conversation about the research than one would expect at a regular presentation, which is part of why scientists like them so much.

## So, what makes a good poster? {-}

* The best posters have high visual appeal, are easily read from a distance (Titles from about 10 feet, content from about 3-5 feet) and guide the reader through your work in a way that makes it easy for them to understand your research and its conclusions.
* Your title should be short but also catchy. That is, you want it to draw your audience in!
* Your overall word count should be no less than 300 words and no more than 800.
* Your content needs to be clear (i.e., easy for the audience to interpret without help, in case you\'re busy with someone else) and concise (stick to the point, so you get it across in the fewest possible words).
* Wherever possible use graphics, colour, font etc. to help guide your audience through the key information.
* Keep displays simple and text brief; your audience should be able to get the main points within 30 seconds. Your presentation will fill them in on the rest.
* Stay away from overly bright coloured boards. Neutral coloured boards are much more pleasing on the eye and will help ensure the content stands out more
* Bullets, numbering and headings will all help your audience to follow the presentation
* The layout should be clean and organized
* The poster must include acknowledgments, your name and the institution this project was affiliated with (So, in your case, the University of British Columbia Okanagan)

## Getting started… the hardest part! {-}

Start by thinking about who this presentation is for. So, in your case you will be presenting to your BIOL116 lab mates and some of the teaching assistants.

Next think about what exactly you want to tell them. For example, to understand your research, they likely need to know what your **research question** was, how you went about **testing your hypothesis**, and, most importantly, what were the **conclusions** that you drew, based on the research that you conducted. Some of the details of your work will be vital to the understanding of the work, while others maybe don\'t need to be highlighted quite so prominently on the poster. 

<div class="note">
Don\'t Procrastinate!

Think about these things well ahead of time and make a list of all the things you want to say and put them in a list of priority. The top items should make it on the poster while the rest can be saved for your presentation. If there was one thing you wanted your audience to know (we often call this the \'take home message\') what would that be?
</div>

Next take a step back, grab a pencil and start to sketch out a small poster to scale. What are the proportions you will be working with and what all do you need to include? Play around with the overall look placing content and diagrams/figures where you think it visually looks nice. A little bit of graphic design experience can be helpful here, but its not required. You can also do this by marking off an area on the floor or table base on the exact size of your poster, print off your content and/or diagrams and figures and see what needs to change.

Use a text hierarchy; meaning you have established a convention with the font sizes and styles that helps the audience easily recognize the order of importance of your information. Titles and subtitles should always be the largest, and visible from the furthest away (so that you can draw in potential readers to view your work). Other content can usually be a bit smaller (but still legible from at least 3-5 feet away).

# Samples & Examples {-}

There is additional information about the following example posters on [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca), including a detailed breakdown of the mark we gave these posters. We have also included one more example of a scientific poster that was built for a different purpose, but we took it and applied the BIOL116 rubric to see how it would score.

## A Well Designed Poster {-}

Based on the rubric you were provided the poster below would score 93/93 (100%). Remember you do not need to follow this exactly but rather this is more to help you see how the rubric can be followed and what you need to be looking for.

![Figure 1. A Well Designed Poster.<br />Poster design by Dr. Tristyn Hay.](figures_images/Lab10-Fig1.png)

## A Poster with Room for Improvement {-}

Here is an example of a poster which scored 46.5/93 (50%).

The poster shown below was one that Dr. Robin built during her Ph.D. Since this poster was developed for a different purpose than BIOL116, it had a different goal than your BIOL116 poster, and was considered to be an excellent poster for that purpose. If we apply the BIOL116 poster rubric to the poster, we see that it scores only 46.5/ 93. Not only does this show you some examples of what not to do for your BIOL116 poster session, it also highlights why it is so important you use the Rubric you are given in order to do the very best you can. 

Although the example below does have three distinct columns (as is common in academic posters) There is no experimental design described and there is no much text on this poster, making it look quite gray and boring. Charts and other data are also presented in grey, which doesn\'t help. There isn\'t enough white space, and what space there is gets further broken down by the divider lines. This is often done when students try to fit too much information on the poster. Less is more in the case of a poster! This poster and others can be found on Canvas.

# Poster Printing {-}

Professional posters are usually a printed product. Professional scientists use graphic design software, and get them printed using special large-scale printers (sometimes they even get them printed on fabric instead of paper!). However, this is very expensive, and not something we advise in this course. 

Instead, we would suggest that you use a combination of your high school art project skills, and some design software, to create a poster that follows the guidelines, without breaking the bank. The [following link shows an undergraduate research day by undergraduate students of Douglas College, in New Westminster, BC](https://www.flickr.com/photos/48875799@N03/sets/72157623621098575/show/). Their posters are great examples of lower cost alternatives that make for great posters.

This would also be a good opportunity to review the [data presentation guidelines](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/figures-tables.html) in the Procedures and Guidelines manual.

# Presenting Your Poster {-}

Now that you\'ve got the poster, it\'s time for the poster session, where you will be presenting your poster to your classmates.

You can think of your poster presentation as a type of performance, but also a conversation with your audience. You should know what you want to tell them, but also be prepared for the fact that they will have questions, and specific interests. Before you present, you will need to prepare, much like any singer or actor. This is going to set you up for success!

<div class="note">
Rehearse & Get Feedback

Rehearse what you will be saying to your friends and/or family and ask for feedback. Were you speaking at a normal pace? Were you fidgety? Did your voice carry well enough so that everyone could hear clearly? We often don\'t realize some of the things we do out of habit when we get nervous or are feeling a bit uncertain and so getting that feedback can help you determine where you need to put your energy.
</div>

The more you practice the more comfortable you will be presenting on the day of your presentations. Also have you friends and/or family ask questions to be sure you have a solid understanding of the material you are presenting. You may even want to give them some example questions alongside questions they will have on their own.

Before the poster presentations begin you will want to be sure you are comfortable with the following information:

* Know exactly what your figures, diagrams, tables and poster are telling the audience. You should have no trouble explaining anything found on your poster
* Have a real brief summary memorized in your head. A couple sentences that can give a good overview.
* Have a clear understanding of the key points of your research without needing notes.
* Be ready! Be ready to answer any question with confidence! Be comfortable being able to deal with difficult question that you may not be able to answer fully. (This is why it is always great to have someone not involved in your research ask you questions).

<div class="note">
Never forget...

This is YOUR research, and no one knows it better than you! You have worked hard all term to get to this point, and you should be proud of the work that you did! Presenting your work can be scary, but also exciting and fun! It means you made to the end, and you’ve accomplished something. That is something to celebrate!
