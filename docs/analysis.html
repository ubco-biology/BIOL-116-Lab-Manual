<p>Although it is best practice to make all your data available (e.g. as a table in an appendix), it is also important to summarize and describe your data for the reader, and to present your summaries in a table. The focus here is describing and summarizing the data from the dependent variable. As with graphs, the best approach for describing data depends on the data types.</p>
<p>Note that if you have an independent variable, and if it varied at all during the experiment despite being under your control (most instruments will vary a bit), it is important to plan to describe this also, though often this information is placed in an appendix. Since you'll be presenting your work as a poster, you should be prepared to answer questions about this, in case someone asks you.</p>

<h3>Descriptive Stats</h3>
<p>In these section we will cover the following desriptive stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>mean</li>
<li>median</li>
<li>mode</li>
<li>variance</li>
<li>standard deviation</li>
<li>inter-quartile range</li>
<li>proportion</li>
</ul>
<div id="scenario-1-dependent-variable-is-continuous-quantitative" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Scenario 1 Dependent Variable is Continuous Quantitative</h4>
<p>In this scenario you describe your dependent variable with a pair of descriptors: a measure of centre and a measure of spread.</p>
<p>Measures of centre include the arithmetic <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Mean">mean</a> (a.k.a. the average), the <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Median">median</a>, and the <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Mode">mode</a>. Most of the time we use the average, and it is meant to give an idea of a "typical" value in your dataset.</p>
<p>On its own, a measure of centre is not particularly useful, because one doesn't know if all data points are close to the "typical" (average) value, or if most of them are quite different from the average (in which case your average value isn't particularly "typical"!). This is why we need to describe the spread of your data too. Measures of spread include the <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Variance">variance</a> (<em>s</em><sup>2</sup>), the <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Standard-deviation">standard deviation</a> ("<em>s</em>"), and the <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Inter-quartile-range">inter-quartile range</a> (IQR). The IQR is described in detail at this link <strong>NEED LINK HERE</strong>, and is not discussed further here.</p>
<p>You'll learn in BIOL202 that characteristics of your data dictate which pair of descriptors are best suited for describing your data. For now, you should know that the average should be paired with the standard deviation, and this pair is typically the preferred pair to use. The median should be paired with the IQR. The mode is less commonly used in biology.</p>
<p><strong>Variance <span class="math inline">\(s{^2}\)</span></strong> is a measure of how far, on average, data values deviate from the mean. A small variance indicates the data are tightly clustered around the mean. The larger the variance, the more spread out the data. Variance is calculated by summing all the squared deviations from the mean (a deviation is the difference between an individual measurement and the mean) and dividing this sum by the number of data entries minus one.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s^{2} =\frac{ \sum{(x_{i}-x)^{2}}}{n-1}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span></strong> is simply the square root of the variance.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s =\sqrt{(\frac{1}{n-1})\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Calculating and presenting your descriptive statistics</strong></p>
<p>PRO TIP: Most scientific calculators have a "DATA" mode that includes a set of functions for calculating descriptive statistics such as the average and standard deviation. But it is still important that you understand how to do calculations by hand, and what the descriptors represent.</p>
<p>For detailed instructions on how to calculate the mean and standard deviation by hand, consult <strong>this web resource</strong>. If you're keen, you can consult these instructions on how to use the "R" software to do the calculations.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/descriptive-summary-statistics.html%22HYPERLINK%20%22https://pages.learning.github.ubc.ca/vdunbar/Procedural-Documents/biology-guidelines-for-data-presentation.html">UBCO Biology Guidelines for data presentation</a>, measures of spread should be reported to one more decimal place than the number of decimal places that the data entries contain.</p>
<p>If your experiment included a treatment variable that is categorical, like in our plant experiment where the three temperature treatments are handled as ordered categories (10, 20, and 30 degrees), then you should plan to calculate your descriptive statistics on the dependent variable (plant height) using the data from each of the treatment groups separately. So in our example you'd calculate the average and standard deviation of plant height for each of the three groups of height measurements, and report these in a table as described in the <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/descriptive-summary-statistics.html%22HYPERLINK%20%22https://pages.learning.github.ubc.ca/vdunbar/Procedural-Documents/biology-guidelines-for-data-presentation.html">Procedures and Guidelines document</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="scenario-2-dependent-variable-is-categorical" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Scenario 2: Dependent Variable is Categorical</h4>
<p>Recall that for categorical dependent variables, like "food type" in our example choice experiment, we tally the frequency with which each category occurs. Imagine that the low protein food was chosen by 6 of the mice, the high fibre food was chosen 4 times, and the high protein food was chosen 10 times. These data are very straightforward to present as is in a table, but we should also calculate the main descriptive statistic for categorical data, called the "<a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Proportion">proportion</a>" <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. That is simply the frequency of the particular category (say, high fibre food) divided by the total number of trials (or total sample size), here 20. Thus, for the high fibre food, the corresponding proportion <span class="math inline">\(p = 4/20 = 0.2\)</span>. The proportion value should always fall between 0 and 1. You should plan to report both the raw frequencies of each category alongside their corresponding proportions.</p>
<p>If your choice experiment includes an independent categorical variable, such as sex (male / female), then you should calculate and report the raw frequencies and corresponding proportions for each category of the dependent variable (food type) for each category of the independent variable (here, male and female).</p>
<p>Lastly, be sure to report your sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for each treatment group, regardless of what type of variable your dependent variable is. Also make sure to tally any missing values in any of the groups (e.g. that may have arisen due to problems during the experiment).</p>

<div id="statistical-tests" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Statistical Tests</h3>
<p>Now that you have decided what graph will be most appropriate for visualizing and presenting your data once they're collected, and have planned how to describe and summarize your data, it is time to make the key decision on how to best analyse your data to test your hypothesis. This decision is based on the experimental design and the type of data involved. You'll learn in BIOL202 the formal statistical tests that are most appropriate for your study. For now, we'll use less formal but generally effective approaches.</p>
<p>First, we need to cover some foundational statistical concepts. We'll do our best to keep things simple, but the reality is that there's a lot to know to make these decisions appropriately, so at the end of the day there's a limit to how simple this can be, and still be correct. Try not to worry if it doesn't all make sense at first. Take it slow, read it more than once, work with your group, and ask lots of questions of your classmates and your TA… after all, collaboration and teamwork is what science is all about!</p>
<div id="inferential-statistics" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Inferential Statistics</h4>
<p>In the previous section about planning to describe our data, we learned that the average (mean) was a useful descriptor of a "typical value" for a continuous, quantitative variable, and that a &lt;a href=“<a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Proportion" class="uri">https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Proportion</a>&gt;proportion</a> was the best descriptor for categorical variables. We were planning our "descriptive statistics". Now our goal is to plan for drawing <em>inferences</em> from our data about the world at large. We are embarking on <em>inferential statistics</em>.</p>
<p>We now need to cast the descriptors we calculate, like the mean, into a different light: no longer is it a simple, calculated, fixed value; now we consider it an <em>estimate</em> of some true mean in a population at large, and we need to recognize that this calculated value has uncertainty associated with it.</p>
<p>For instance, for our plant experiment, we planned to describe our data, including calculating the mean plant height for each of the three treatment groups. But when it comes time to analyse our experiment data, we switch modes and consider each of those means as <em>estimates</em> of their respective, true population means, specific to each treatment group. But wait, we don't have populations in our experiment! We certainly don't, and experiments never do. However, so long as we <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Random-assignment">randomly assigned</a> our plants to our treatment groups, then we can safely assume that the average response we observe among the individuals in a given treatment group is <em>representative</em> of what we would observe if we were to subject a different random sample of plants from the same population to the exact same experimental conditions.</p>
<p>We need to remember, however, that individuals within every population vary in many ways, and therefore if someone else were to conduct the experiment using the exact same conditions, but a new set of randomly chosen subjects (plants), randomly assigned to each treatment group, they will most certainly not get the exact same calculated values for the treatment means. This reflects something called "sampling error", and sampling error is entirely expected! This sampling error is what introduces uncertainty to our estimates. We must recognize that, even though we might have imposed strongly different treatments in an experiment, we can't simply interpret differences between treatment means at face value; we need to take account of the possibility that those differences could have arisen solely due to sampling error.</p>
</div>
<div id="null-and-alternative-hypotheses" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h4>
<p>As scientists, we should approach new ideas and hypotheses with skepticism (even if we're actually excited about them!). We therefore undertake studies like our plant experiment with the working assumption that our research hypothesis is wrong, and we need to be convinced otherwise with good evidence. We recognize that sampling error is ever present, and that it could easily cause us to draw incorrect conclusions about our data.</p>
<p>To formally account for the potential influence of sampling error, and help guard against drawing incorrect conclusions about our study results, we need to formulate two statistical versions of our <em>a priori</em> research hypothesis: a null <strong>hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>)</strong> and an <strong>alternative hypothesis (H<sub>A</sub>)</strong>. These provide clear and <em>testable</em> statements about what study outcomes would look like if the hypothesis was NOT supported (H<sub>0</sub>), and what would be observed if the hypothesis was supported (H<sub>A</sub>). In other words, the null hypothesis is what we expect to observe if only sampling error were at play. The alternative hypothesis is what we expect to see if there was a biological effect at play that was strong enough to overcome the influences of sampling error.</p>
<p>Continuing with our plant experiment example, and recognizing that for this study design the suitable analysis is to compare average values of the dependent variable across treatment groups (see next section), we could write our null and alternative hypotheses as follows:</p>
<p>H<sub>0</sub>: The average height of plants grown under different temperatures does not differ after 14 days</p>
<p>H<sub>A</sub>: The average height of plants grown under different temperatures does differ after 14 days</p>
<p>Correspondingly, the null hypothesis represents the status quo, i.e. nothing going on, and it is this hypothesis that we objectively and directly test through experimentation and statistical analyses; only if the evidence is strong enough to reject the null hypothesis would we conclude that the data are consistent with the alternative hypothesis, which itself reflects what we expect to see if our research hypothesis were correct.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that a failure to reject the null hypothesis <strong>does not mean that the null hypothesis is true; it simply means that there is insufficient evidence to reject it at this stage</strong>. Likewise, evidence consistent with the alternative hypothesis is just that: evidence that is <em>consistent</em> with there being an effect of temperature on plant height. Only after sufficient and independent replication of the experiment should we conclude that our research hypothesis is true. After all, there are many factors that influence how robust your experiment is, and how likely it is to reflect the "truth". We call this the <strong>power</strong> of your study. Your methods, sample size, and the number of times you repeat the experiment and draw the same conclusion all play into the power of the work that you do, and how likely your results represent the underlying laws of nature.</p>
</div>
<div id="significance-confidence" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Significance &amp; Confidence</h4>
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses are typically formulated at the same time you decide which test is best suited for your study (see the next section). Also, at the same time you need to decide a clear criterion upon which to base your decision about whether the evidence is strong enough to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative. This decision should be guided by a number of factors, but for the present purposes we'll go with the traditional approach, which is to guard strongly against making a mistake of a "false positive", i.e. rejecting the null hypothesis when in fact nothing was going on (it should not be rejected). Specifically, we set what's called a "significance level" (denoted with the Greek letter alpha) at 0.05, or 5%. This means that we're willing to make that "false positive" mistake at most 5% of the time, on average. In practice, this means that the evidence needs to be pretty strong to reject the null hypothesis. The corollary of the 5% significance level is something called the "level of confidence". That is, using a 5% significance level is the same as having a 95% level of confidence in something. We'll see how the significance level and level of confidence are used below.</p>
<p>You might reasonably ask: "Hold on a minute: how come we use such an arbitrary and hard criterion for deciding when something becomes "statistically significant" (i.e. evidence strong enough to reject the null hypothesis)?" That's a fantastic question! It turns out that the practice of statistics is slowly moving away from this overly rigid approach. That, however, is an idea to be explored later in your degree (possibly in BIOL202?). For now, however, we'll stick with tradition.</p>

<h4>Comparing Means Among Treatment Groups</h4>
<div id="scenario-1-continuous-quantitative-dependent-variable-and-categorical-independent-variable" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Scenario 1: Continuous Quantitative Dependent Variable and Categorical Independent Variable</h5>
<p>This scenario is typical of <strong>measured response experiments</strong> like our plant experiment.</p>
<p>In this scenario the typical approach is to compare the average value (the mean) of your dependent variable among the treatment groups.</p>
<p>Our approach aims to determine whether any of the treatment groups' means differ "significantly" from any of the other group means. At first glance, that seems straightforward: If the mean height of plants subjected to 30 degrees was 22.2cm, and the mean height of plants subjected to 20 degrees was 18.2cm, then clearly the warmer temperature treatment yielded a significantly greater average height, right?</p>
<p>We must remember: we're now conducting inferential statistics, so each of the treatment group means has <em>uncertainty</em> associated with it owing to sampling error, and that uncertainty should cause us some pause. We need to be convinced, with some level of confidence, that the difference we observe between the group means could not simply have arisen due to sampling error, but rather was most likely due to our experimental treatments.</p>
<p>We start by writing down our statistical null and alternative hypotheses:</p>
<p>H<sub>0</sub>: The average height of plants grown under different temperatures does not differ after 14 days</p>
<p>H<sub>A</sub>: The average height of plants grown under different temperatures does differ after 14 days</p>
<p>Next, as instructed in the previous section, we need to decide what "significance level" we wish to use. You'll learn in BIOL202 that there are many factors that influence this decision. For now, we'll follow the standard and use a 5% significance level. In short, this means that we're willing to make a false positive mistake in our conclusion at most about 5% of the time, on average.</p>
<p>Next, we plan to calculate something called the 95% <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Confidence-interval">Confidence interval</a> for the Mean for our response (dependent) variable, and we do this for each of our treatment groups separately.</p>
<p>What purpose does the 95% Confidence interval for the Mean have? Put simply, it provides a range of values within which we are 95% confident the <em>true</em> population mean lies. It is a way of expressing the uncertainty in our estimate, and reflects the existence of sampling error. The specific decision to use a 95% level of confidence corresponds to the 5% level of significance, as we learned previously.</p>
<p>To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean, we need the standard deviation and the sample size (n), both of which we learned about previously.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[CI=\overline{y}\pm 1.96 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{y}\)</span> is the mean, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the standard deviation and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sample size. The value of <span class="math inline">\(1.96\)</span> in the equation represents what's known as the Z-value, or Z-score. It's a little bit beyond the scope of this course to go into it, but it reflects the 95% level of confidence (or 5% significance level) that was decided upon in advance (if we decided to use a different level of confidence then the 1.96 would be changed to a something else).</p>
<p>Once we have calculated each of the treatment group means and their respective 95% confidence intervals, we can use these to make a reasonable judgment about which, if any, group means differ significantly (with 95% confidence) from any others. Specifically, if the 95% confidence intervals of any treatment group means do not overlap, we can conclude, with 95% confidence, that they are significantly different, and that the difference reflects something other than sampling error. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis in favour of our alternative hypothesis, and conclude that temperature did have a significant effect on plant height after 14 days.</p>
<p>When the 95% confidence intervals overlap, discrepancies between treatment means could have arisen solely due to sampling error. Thus, we don't reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the data are consistent with there being no effect. <strong>Remember</strong>, this doesn't necessarily mean the null hypothesis is true! We simply don't have any evidence to suggest it's false.</p>

<h4>Comparing Frequencies to a Baseline Expectation</h4>
<div id="scenario-2-categorical-dependent-variable-without-an-independent-variable" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Scenario 2: Categorical Dependent Variable Without an Independent Variable</h5>
<p>This scenario is typical of <strong>choice experiments,</strong> like the one described above with mice choosing among food types. The single categorical response variable is "food type". You can imagine that if there was a strong preference for one of the three food types, then that food type would be chosen more frequently by the mice than the others. Alternatively, if there was no preference, then one would expect all three food types to be selected with similar frequency.</p>
<p>As skeptical scientists, this latter "status quo" scenario should be our working hypothesis, and evidence would need to be strong and clear to convince us otherwise. We need a way to quantitatively test this.</p>
<p>For this scenario in which we have a single categorical dependent variable, we use something called a <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Chi-squared-goodness-of-fit-test"><span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span> goodness-of-fit test</a> (when we say it, we often call it the chi-squared test, and pronounce the greek letter, <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>, as Kai), which quantifies the "fit" of observed frequencies to those expected if nothing were going on.</p>
<p>We now formulate suitably worded null and alternative hypotheses:</p>
<p>H<sub>0</sub>: The three food types are chosen with equal frequency by the mice (or something similarly clear).</p>
<p>H<sub>A</sub>: The three food types are NOT chosen with equal frequency by the mice (or something similarly clear).</p>
<p>Although the test is relatively straightforward to undertake, you can make use of an online app to do the test. Nevertheless, below we show you what's involved, since you'll still need to interpret the results.</p>
<p>PRO TIP: If there are only 2 categories in the dependent variable, then the most powerful statistical test to use is a <strong>binomial test</strong>, but a <span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span> goodness-of-fit test will still work.</p>
<p>Here is the formula to calculate the value of <span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span> test statistic:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT FORMULA HERE</strong></p>
<p>The value of the <span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span> test statistic increases in magnitude as the overall discrepancy between observed and expected frequencies increases.</p>
<p>Recall that we need to consider <em>sampling error</em>, and the fact that sampling error will itself cause discrepancies between observed and expected frequencies. So we need to decide on a threshold value of <span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span>, called the "critical value", that will be large enough to convince us that something is very likely going on, and we should reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative.</p>
<p>The exact value for this "critical value" is based in part on the significance level that we set earlier, i.e. 5%, and on the number of categories that our dependent variable has. The online app decides this for you based on your inputs.</p>
<p>If our calculated value of <span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span> is greater than the critical value of <span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span>, then we reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative, and conclude that "Mice do show a preference for food type, as the three different food types were not chosen with equal frequency."</p>
</div>
<div id="scenario-3-categorical-dependent-variable-and-one-categorical-independent-variable" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Scenario 3: Categorical Dependent Variable and one Categorical Independent Variable</h5>
<p>This scenario is also typical of "choice experiments", and above we provided one example in which we hypothesized that female mice showed a food preference whereas males do not. In this case, we plan to conduct something called a <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Chi-squared-contingency-test"><span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span> contingency test</a>, also called a <span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span> test of association. For example, if indeed we were correct with our research hypothesis, then the evidence would show that a preference for food type is <em>contingent</em> on the sex of the mouse.</p>
<p>The appropriate null and alternative hypotheses are:</p>
<p>H<sub>0</sub>: The three food types are chosen with equal frequency by male and female mice.</p>
<p>H<sub>A</sub>: The three food types are not chosen with equal frequency by male and female mice.</p>
<p>An alternative but less effective wording that is common to see is:</p>
<p>H<sub>0</sub>: There is no association between food preference and sex.</p>
<p>H<sub>A</sub>: There is an association between food preference and sex.</p>
<p>The latter statements are more ambiguous with respect to quantitative predictions. Nevertheless, they are acceptable.</p>
<p>Again, we plan what <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Significance-level">significance level</a> to use: 5%. Based on this significance level, and on the number of categories in our dependent and independent variables, we would figure out what the critical value of <span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span> is for our test. But in our case, we'll again use an online app for the test.</p>
<p>If our calculated value of <span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span> is greater than the critical value of <span class="math inline">\(\chi{^2}\)</span>, then we reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative, and conclude that "Food preference is contingent on the sex of the mouse, because males and females chose the food types with different frequencies."</p>
